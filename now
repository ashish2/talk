on clicking Send button,
it will just send the data to the socket.channel 
& that will dynamically update the chat on the frontend.

on smiley click, just append the (vector smiley copied from bootstrap) smiley text image in textarea.

bugs

>
//both ppls chat is not visible. only 1 is visible

>
//from usre list, shud be able to chat with anybody, not just index[0]

>
//y user shows twice in room userlist, even when user is conneccted only once.

>
//1st client that connects, gets all user list,
//but later ones dont get whole user list, they only get clients connected after them

>
//on userList click, try, ng-click = hide/show the div, see ng-show, ng-hide etc, try solving with angular

>
//-
the message is broadcasting to everyone, since its a common room, and wichever div is visible over there the 
message gets added, instead of the actual div with socket id,
all common mesages shud be appended in #all div id,
and, personal messages shud append in #socket_id div
so now, make 1 socket for personal rooms, whichever socket has a lower, that comes first in room id format, 
like lowerSockID_higherSockID & append to that socket_id div

>
//guess both sockets are not connected to the room,

>
//dont broadcast to all sockets, only send to friends socket

>
//msg append not happening for other user

>
//x scroll shudnt come

>
//bubble comes animation
though acheived with js, this shud be acheived ideally with ng

>
get variable from js to jade to load dynamically the required server config file

>
define local & live server for heroku,
same way, mite be required to define,
dev environment for Live server & Local server,
same type env for multiple servers
